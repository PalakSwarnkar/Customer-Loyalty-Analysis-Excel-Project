# Customer Loyalty & Churn Analysis — Excel Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer loyalty and churn behavior for a telecom company. Using Excel, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights how customers behave across different services, payment types, contract lengths, and tenure groups. The goal of this project was to identify what keeps customers loyal, what drives churn, and which customer segments create the most revenue.

The dashboard provides a clean, visual summary of customer behavior and helps businesses quickly identify retention opportunities.

### 📊 Dashboard Preview

Telecom companies often struggle with:

- High churn rates  
- Low loyalty among new customers  
- Revenue loss from customers leaving early  
- Limited visibility into churn patterns  

This dashboard solves these issues by giving a clear, data-backed story of:

- Who is staying  
- Who is leaving  
- Why they might be leaving  
- Which groups are most valuable  
- Which behaviors indicate churn risk  

---

## Project Goals

- Present customer loyalty and churn insights in a simple, easy-to-understand format  
- Identify the customer segments most at risk of leaving  
- Highlight revenue distribution across different customer groups  
- Give business teams (marketing, customer care, retention) a quick way to understand customer patterns  

---

## Dataset Summary

The dataset includes:

- Customer tenure (in months, grouped into 0–6 years)  
- Contract type (Monthly, One-Year, Two-Year)  
- Internet service type  
- Payment methods  
- Monthly charges  
- Revenue  
- Loyalty category (New, Engaged, Loyal)  
- Churn status  

Each of these fields plays a role in understanding customer loyalty and behavior.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1️⃣ Dataset Structuring and Understanding
Before building any dashboard, I reviewed all fields and ensured they were properly formatted for analysis. I standardized important columns like:

- Loyalty Level  
- Tenure Group  
- Payment Method  
- Gender  

This step ensures the visuals are meaningful and easy to read.

---

### 2️⃣ Creating Tenure Groups
To make customer duration easier to study, I grouped customer tenure into:

- 0–1 Year  
- 1–2 Years  
- 2–3 Years  
- 3–4 Years  
- 4–5 Years  
- 5–6 Years  

This helps identify whether long-term customers behave differently than short-term customers.

---

### 3️⃣ Building KPI Cards
I created clean, modern KPI cards showing:

- Total Customers  
- Churn Rate  
- Average Monthly Charges  

These KPIs give a quick snapshot of business performance. They are placed at the top to draw immediate attention.

### 4️⃣ Adding Slicers for Interactivity
I added slicers for:

- Tenure Group  
- Contract Type  

This allows anyone using the dashboard to filter data instantly and see how results change.

---

### 5️⃣ Designing Insightful Visuals
I designed several visuals to answer critical business questions:

✔ **Loyalty Breakdown (Donut Chart)** — % of Loyal, Engaged, and New customers  
✔ **Churn by Internet Service Type** — highlights risky services  
✔ **Churn by Payment Method** — identifies billing risk patterns  
✔ **Revenue by Gender** — simple demographic insight  

Each chart aligns with real business questions.
